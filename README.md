# Longitudinal-Data-Analysis

This is the repository for binary longitudinal data analysis with missingness. A mixed-effect latent class conditional logistic regression model was developed. It achieved consistent parameter estimation under various missingness patterns. The two simulations under different generating methods both show a consistent estimate of the model.
